- **objective:**

  Reimplement timer_sleep(), defined in devices/timer.c.

---


- Although a working implementation is provided,
- it busy waits,

    it spins in a loop checking the current time and calling `thread_yield()` until enough time has gone by.

- **Reimplement it to avoid busy waiting.**



`void timer_sleep (int64_t ticks);

Suspends execution of the calling thread until time has advanced by at least x
timer ticks. Unless the system is otherwise idle, the thread need not wake up
after exactly x ticks. Just put it on the ready queue after they have waited
for the right amount of time.


timer_sleep() is useful for threads that operate in real-time, e.g. for
blinking the cursor once per second. The argument to timer_sleep() is expressed
in timer ticks, not in milliseconds or any another unit. There are TIMER_FREQ
timer ticks per second, where TIMER_FREQ is a macro defined in devices/timer.h.
The default value is 100. We don't recommend changing this value, because any
change is likely to cause many of the tests to fail.


Separate functions timer_msleep(), timer_usleep(), and timer_nsleep() do exist
for sleeping a specific number of milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds,
respectively, but these will call timer_sleep() automatically when necessary.
You do not need to modify them. The alarm clock implementation is not needed
for later projects, although it could be useful for project 4.
